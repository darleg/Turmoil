# Turmoil
This is where the rubber meets the road and this is the place I well put my code for
things like Complexity, Dynamical Systens, Strange Attractors, Fractals, and just plain
Chaos. This was relocated to darleg because most of the repos here are somewhat chaotic
until you understand the math behind them.
